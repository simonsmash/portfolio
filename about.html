<p align="center">Whats good, my name is simon thach. I like to fix cars and some other stuff.
    I like chicken and i like noodles. I also like world history. Did you know that the body
    of ghengis khan was never found. What i also like to play is video games. When it comes 
    to video games, i am not competitive, but i do like to win. When i play with my friends, 
    i am not serious. When it comes to education, im serious. I really wantt to be as the same 
    as my sister or even better. i want to be a automotive mechanic or a biomedical engineer.
    I also want to have a sub major in business. Shopping is a fun thing for me, Even when it 
    is just for food. My favorite clothing brands are American Eagle, nike, adidas, champion,
    and tommy hilfiger. I like to go to places i never went. When i go somewhere for the first 
    time, i just focus on the weather and noise. Those are the things i enjoy in life.</p>
