            <p align="center">Hello everyone, my name is simon thach. I am a student here at the program called SMASH wharton. I am a main
                student at olney charter high school. when it comes to hobbies, I like to fix cars and play baseball. I also
                like world history. Did you know that the body of ghengis khan was never found. When it comes to education,
                im serious. I really want to be as the same as my sister or even better. She is a nurse at penn medicine.
                But, I want to be an automotive mechanic or a biomedical engineer. Through my future, i hope to enjoy it
                at my very last. Those are the things i enjoy in life.
            </p>
